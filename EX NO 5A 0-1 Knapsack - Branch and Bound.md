# EX 5A 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Branch&Bound 
## DATE:
## AIM:
To Write a Java program to solve 0/1 Knapsack problem using Branch and Bound Approach.
You are heading a college entrepreneurship cell that can invest in up to N student‑startups.

For each startup i you know: cost[i]  — the amount (in ₹ lakh) required to join the showcase profit[i] — the estimated profit (in ₹ lakh) you’ll gain if it succeeds You have a total budget of B ₹ lakh. Pick a subset of startups so that the sum of costs ≤ B and the sum of profits is maximised.

Because N can be as large as 50, a plain exhaustive search (2^N) is too slow.

The recommended approach is Branch & Bound with a fractional‑knapsack upper bound (but any algorithm that meets the constraints is accepted). 

Input Format

N

B

cost[1] cost[2] … cost[N]

profit[1] profit[2] … profit[N]

1 ≤ N ≤ 50

1 ≤ B ≤ 1 000 000

1 ≤ cost[i], profit[i] ≤ 10 000 

Output Format

maxProfit

For example:
