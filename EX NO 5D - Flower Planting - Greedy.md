# EX 5D Flower Planting.
## DATE: 31/10/2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given n gardens, labelled from 1 to n.

You also have a list called paths, where each element paths[i] = [xi, yi] represents a bidirectional road connectingthe  garden xi and garden yi.

You want to plant one flower in each garden, and there are exactly 4 types of flowers labelled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Your goal is to plant flowers such that:

No two connected gardens (i.e., connected via a path) have the same flower type.

Return any valid flower assignment as an array where:

answer[i] is the flower type planted in the (i+1) ᵗʰ garden

It is guaranteed that:

No garden is connected to more than 3 other gardens

A valid flower assignment always exists

## Algorithm

1. **Input:**

   * Read the number of gardens `n` and the number of paths `m`.
   * Read each path pair `(u, v)` that connects two gardens.

2. **Graph Construction:**

   * Create an adjacency list for all gardens.
   * For every path `(u, v)`, add each garden to the other's adjacency list.

3. **Initialization:**

   * Create an integer array `flowers[n]` to store the flower type (1–4) assigned to each garden.
   * Each garden can have one of four flower types.

4. **Assignment Logic:**

   * For each garden `i`, check all adjacent gardens.
   * Mark the flower types already used by its neighbors and assign the first available flower type to garden `i`.

5. **Output:**

   * Print the final flower type assigned to each garden in order.
