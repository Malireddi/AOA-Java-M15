# EX 5D Flower Planting.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given n gardens, labelled from 1 to n.

You also have a list called paths, where each element paths[i] = [xi, yi] represents a bidirectional road connectingthe  garden xi and garden yi.

You want to plant one flower in each garden, and there are exactly 4 types of flowers labelled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Your goal is to plant flowers such that:

No two connected gardens (i.e., connected via a path) have the same flower type.

Return any valid flower assignment as an array where:

answer[i] is the flower type planted in the (i+1) ᵗʰ garden

It is guaranteed that:

No garden is connected to more than 3 other gardens

A valid flower assignment always exists
